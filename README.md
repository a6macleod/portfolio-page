This site is a basic portfolio to introduce who I am and show example projects and websites that I have built.

The site is built using create-react-app. All the information for the example projects are stored as state on the App.js file.

To add an example project, create a new object in the array exampleProjects. The object should contain a title, goal, tech, link, code, img, and imgAlt keys. The values should be as follows.

    - title: what the project should be called.
    - goal: A quick recap of what the project is, and if there was a specific focus for building it. This synopsis should be about 50 words or less.
    -tech: What technologies were used to create it generally and where a working example can be seen/where it is hosted (i.e. github pages).
    -link: a link to the working example
    code: a link to the code repository
    img: a screenshot of the site. This will look best if it is a smaller picture for example tablet size or smaller.
    imgAlt: An description for the screenshot to be added as the img alt.
